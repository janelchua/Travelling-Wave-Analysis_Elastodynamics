# Travelling-Wave-Analysis_Elastodynamics
High velocity moving body point source
Two python files are contained in this repository, one with viscous stress and one without. 

Python file with viscous stress contains a mixed method formulation for dealing with higher order derivatives and coded up with mixed element shape functions (FEniCS specific function)
